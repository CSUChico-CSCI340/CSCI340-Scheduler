#Writing a Scheduler
California State University - Chico

By Bryan Dixon

##Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is for you gain insight into how schedulers work on the system.

##Logistics
The only ‚Äúhand-in‚Äù will be electronic. Any clarifications and revisions to the assignment will be posted here and emailed out to the class.

##Hand Out Instructions

I recommend you use an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine to complete this assignment. Alternatively, you can use the jaguar machines or your native Linux install.

You should download the project as a zip or clone it locally to the protected directory (the *lab directory*) in which you plan to do your work. Assuming you wish to put it in your home directory and are there:

<pre>
~$ git clone git@github.com:CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI340-Scheduler.git
#Will now have folder CSCI340-Scheduler with files
~$ cd CSCI340-Scheduler/
~/CSCI340-Scheduler$ make
</pre>

Enter your name in the header comment at the top of *schedule.c*.

Looking at the *schedule.c* file, you will see that it contains a rudimentary scheduler API to add a process, remove a process, and get the next process from your scheduler. Your job is to implement the code in schedule.c that implements a variant of a Multi Level Priority Scheduler using Round Robin schedulers.

##General Overview of Schedulers
Taken from Wikipedia[1]
In computer science, scheduling is the method by which threads, processes or data flows are given access
to system resources (e.g. processor time, communications bandwidth). This is usually done to load balance
and share system resources effectively or achieve a target quality of service.  The need for a scheduling
algorithm arises from the requirement for most modern systems to perform multitasking (executing more
than one process at a time) and multiplexing (transmit multiple data streams simultaneously across a single
physical channel).
The scheduler is concerned mainly with:

Throughput
- The total number of processes that complete their execution per time unit.

Latency
, specifically:
‚Äì Turnaround time
- total time between submission of a process and its completion.
‚Äì Response time
-  amount  of  time  it  takes  from  when  a  request  was  submitted  until  the  first
response is produced.

Fairness
- Equal CPU time to each process (or more generally appropriate times according to each
process‚Äô priority and workload).
2

Waiting Time
- The time the process remains in the ready queue.
In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g.  throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a
suitable compromise. Preference is given to any one of the above mentioned concerns depending upon the
user‚Äôs needs and objectives.
In real-time environments, such as embedded systems for automatic control in industry (for example robotics),
the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet deadlines; this is crucial for keeping the system sta-
ble.  Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and managed through an
administrative back end.
Your Task
The task for this assignment is to implement the scheduler API provided to you in the
schedule.c
file with variant of a multi level priority scheduler using Round Robin schedulers.  This scheduler iterates
through the different levels starting with the highest priority (priority 1) and choses the process next in the
queue for that priority level to schedule for a specified quanta or time.  The higher the priority the more
quanta is given. Your implementation should mirror the quanta and number of priorities shown in Figure 1.
You aren‚Äôt allowed to import any libraries not already provided in the
schedule.c
file.
Data Structures in C
As you can‚Äôt include any libraries for data structures you‚Äôll likely want to implement your own data structure
to implement the FCFS scheduler. As such you‚Äôll need to do this in C code. As an example here is a simple
implementation of a linked list in C using structs:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct node {
int value;
struct node
*
next;
};
int main(){
int i;
/
*
This will be the unchanging first node
*
/
struct node
*
root;
/
*
cur node for manipulating linked list
*
/
struct node
*
cur;
/
*
3
*
Now root points to a node struct
*
Dynamic allocation of memory the size of
*
a node in C (similar to new node in C++)
*
/
root = (struct node
*
) malloc( sizeof(struct node));
cur = root;
for(i=0; i<10;i++){
cur->value = i;
cur->next = (struct node
*
) malloc( sizeof(struct node));
cur = cur->next;
}
//Create final values
cur->value = 10;
cur->next = NULL;
/
*
Now let‚Äôs print it out
*
/
cur=root;
while(cur){
printf("%d ", cur->value);
cur=cur->next;
}
printf("\n");
/
*
Let‚Äôs free up memory
*
/
while(root){
cur = root;
root = root->next;
free(cur); //like delete
}
}
Checking Your Work
I have provided some tools to help you check your work.
Reference solution.
I‚Äôve included a reference output file with the expected solution. Your program should
produce identical output to that of the
ref.out
file. There is also a
simref
executable that will generate
the reference output as well.

Hints

Read
Section 6.3
of the Operating System Concepts Essentials 2nd edition book.
Evaluation
Your solution will be tested agains the reference output.  You will get full credit if your assignment repro-
duces the reference output.
Hand In Instructions
You only have to change
schedule.c
. You need to upload
schedule.c
to the
http://turnin.ecst.csuchico.edu/
page to mark your completion time.
